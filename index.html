    <h2>Closures Hands On</h2>

     <div>
        <p>Q1: Print output: </p>

     <pre>
        OUTPUT:
            1
            2
            3
            4

        REASON:
        The output is 1, 2, 3, 4 because the counter function returns an inner function IncreaseCounter,
        which increments a private counter variable. Each time counter() is called,
        it increases and returns the updated counter value, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 with each call.

     </div>
     <pre>
        OUTPUT:
            1
            0

        REASON:
        The code defines a global variable count with an initial value of 0.
        Inside an IIFE, there's a local variable count declared with the let keyword,
        shadowing the global count. When count is logged within the if block, it displays 1.
        Outside the if block, the local variable goes out of scope, and the global count remains 0, so it logs 0.

     <pre>
        OUTPUT:
            3
            3
            3

        REASON:
        The output of the function is 3, printed three times with a 1000ms delay between each log.
        This happens because the for loop completes before setTimeout executes,
        and it captures the final value of i, which is 3, in a closure.

     <div>
        <p>Q4: Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer 
        function should accept parameter length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.</p>
     </div>
     <div>
        <img src="./Codesnap/Question4.png" alt="No-Image">
     </div>
     <pre>
        Explanation:
            in this code, there are 2 functions outer function lengthFun which has length as parameter
            and inner function calArea which has breadth as parameter
            and inside calArea function, calculation for area of rectangle has been done.
            also console.log statement has been call in calArea function.

        <div>
            <p>Q5: Take a variable in outer function and create an inner function to increase the counter every time it is called</p>
        </div>
        <div>

        </div>
        <pre>
            OUTPUT:
                ReferenceError: counter is not defined

            REASON:
            This error occurs because the counter variable is scoped to the outerFunction,
            and it cannot be accessed from outside that function's scope.

        <pre>
            OUTPUT:
                12

            REASON:
            IIFE creates a closure over the outer scope,
            allowing it to access the variable a from the enclosing scope.
            In this case, it successfully accesses and alerts the value of a, which is 12.

        <pre>
            OUTPUT:
                undefined

            REASON:
            The output is undefined because of variable hoisting in JavaScript.
            The variable a is declared inside the function with var,
            so its declaration is hoisted to the top of the function scope,
            making it available but uninitialized at the time of the console.log(a) statement.

            <p>Q8: Print the Output: </p>

        <pre>
            OUTPUT:
                outerArg = 123
                innerArg = 456
                outerVar = a
                innerVar = b
                globalVar = xyz

            REASON:
            outerFunc is invoked with outerArg equal to 123.
            Inside outerFunc, innerFunc is invoked with innerArg equal to 456.
            Inside innerFunc, the variables innerVar, outerVar, and globalVar are logged along with their values.
            All variables are correctly scoped, and their values are accessed as expected from their respective scopes.
